## Adapters Table

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Explanation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| adapter_id | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for each adapter |
| adapter_name | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Name of the adapter |
| manufacturer_id | INT | NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY | Links to the Manufacturers table |
| type | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL | Type or category of the adapter |
| release_date | DATE | | Release date of the adapter |

**Reasoning**: 
- SERIAL is used for adapter_id to automatically generate unique identifiers.
- VARCHAR(255) for adapter_name allows for long, descriptive names.
- manufacturer_id as a foreign key maintains referential integrity with the Manufacturers table.
- release_date is included for historical tracking and potential version differentiation.

## Manufacturers Table

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Explanation |

| rating | INT | CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5) | User rating for the adapter |
| comment | TEXT | | User's detailed feedback |
| submission_date | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Date and time of feedback submission |
